# Carpentry-Macro

This is a pretty basic carpentry macro but it works well enough! (a little bit hard-coded but is alright)

```PLEASE NOTE!:``` There may be some bugs, so dm me on discord (JimmyWasHere#6594) and let me know!

# Tutorial on how to use

`*make sure you have a **COMPLETELY CLEAR** inventory prior to starting the macro* `

```Step 1:``` Set the keybind to start the macro in game settings (the keybind is 'F' by default)

```Step 2:``` Create a buy order for x amount of enchanted diamonds (preferrably 71,680 for maximal efficiency)

```Step 3:``` Wait for order to fill a little bit; if it doesn't, cancel it and re-order

```Step 4:``` Start macro! It will start claiming enchanted diamonds from bazaar and crafting them into blocks.

You can turn off the macro at any time when you want to stop, as it will run continually unless you don't (even when there's no diamonds left to claim)
^^I will fix this in the near future.
